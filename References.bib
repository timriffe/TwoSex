	migration is negatively associated with both labour and non-labour
	input allocation in agriculture, while no significant differences
	can be detected in terms of farm technical efficiency or agricultural
	income. Whether the rapid demographic changes in rural areas triggered
	by massive migration, possibly combined with propitious land and
	rural development policies, will ultimately produce the conditions
	for a more viable, high-return agriculture attracting larger investments
	remains to be seen.},
