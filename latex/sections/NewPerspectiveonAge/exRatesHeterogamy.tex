First, note that the observed bivariate $e_x$-distribution of birth counts is
very nearly identical to the expected distribution\footnote{The expected
distribution is defined as in Equation~\eqref{eq:expected}}.
Figure~\ref{fig:US1970obsexpex} compares these two distributions for birth 
counts in the USA in 1970 (compare with Figure~\ref{fig:US1970obsexp}). 

\begin{figure}[ht!]

It is
difficult to see any difference between the two surfaces in
Figure~\ref{fig:US1970obsexpex}, however we can measure the degree of
separation, $\theta$\footnote{See Equation~\eqref{eq:coefdiff}. Recall that 0 signifies
perfect overlap and 1 signifies perfect separation between the two
distributions}, just as for age-classified births (Compare with
Figure~\ref{fig:Theta}). One provisionally concludes that $e_x$-matching of
parents, at least with this level of approximation, appears to be very close to
random\footnote{While confidence bands would help make a stronger case in this
instance, the author did not have ready access to an implementation for
calulating variance for the present statistic difference coefficient. For an
idea of the degree of significance, though, we can look to the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test significance
for an idea of whether the two matrices might plausibly come from different
theoretical distributions. In this case, the null hypothesis is that
the two samples
come from the same distribution, where low p-values indicate
that there is evidence to the contrary. P-values for the present data were
high, in the range of 0.98, in both countries, such that we cannot conclude
that the observed and expected distributions come from different theoretical
distributions. We therefore may as well operate as if it were the case
that the bivariate
distribution of $e_x$-classified birth counts is roughly the same as the
expected distribution.}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
        \centering  
          \caption{Departure from association-free bivariate distribution of
          birth counts cross-classified by $e_x$ of mother and father. USA,

Since the bivariate distribution by mothers' and fathers' $e_x$ is so close
to random, one could very closely replicate the full cross-classified matrix 
given only the two marginal
$e_x$ birth distributions by applying Equation~\eqref{eq:expected}.
