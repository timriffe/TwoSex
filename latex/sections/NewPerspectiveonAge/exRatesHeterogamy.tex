First, note that the observed bivariate $e_x$-distribution of birth counts is
very nearly identical to the expected distribution\footnote{The expected
distribution is defined as in Equation~\eqref{eq:expected}}.
Figure~\ref{fig:US1970obsexpex} compares these two distributions for birth counts in the USA in 1970 (compare with Figure~\ref{fig:US1970obsexp}). 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
        \centering  
          \caption{Observed versus expected bivariate distribution of birth
          counts by $e_x$-distribution of parents, 1970, USA}

It is
difficult to see any difference between the two surfaces in
Figure~\ref{fig:US1970obsexpex}, however we can measure the degree of
separation, $\theta$\footnote{See Equation~\eqref{eq:coefdiff}. Recall that 0 signifies
perfect overlap and 1 signifies perfect separation between the two
distributions}, just as for age-classified births (Compare with
Figure~\ref{fig:Theta}). One provisionally concludes that $e_x$-matching of
parents, at least with this level of approximation, appears to be very close to random.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
        \centering  
          \caption{Departure from association-free bivariate distribution of
          birth counts cross-classified by $e_x$ of mother and father. USA,
          1969-2010 and Spain, 1975-2009}

          \label{fig:TotalVarobsexpex}
\end{figure}

Since the bivariate distribution by mothers' and fathers' $e_x$ is so close
to random, one could very closely replicate the full cross-classified matrix 
given only the two marginal
$e_x$ birth distributions by applying Equation~\eqref{eq:expected}.
