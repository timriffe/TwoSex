The resulting
population structure from applying Formula~\eqref{eq:dxredist} to age-classified
population data is diachronous\footnote{heterogeneous with respect to age} 
within any given level of remaining life expectancy, and 
looks like Figures~\ref{fig:exPyrUS} and \ref{fig:exPyrES}\footnote{The idea to
redistribute the population pyramid in this way is due to a conversation with 
John MacInnes, and appears in \citep{MacInnes2013pop} (unpublished) using a
different method.} for the years 1975 and 2009 in the US and
Spain\footnote{The unlabeled inside cover artwork is the same 2009 pyramid (in
green) but preceeded by history (grey) and continued with a deterministic
projection (blue) under specific assumptions (Spain left, US right, vertical
axes comparable, horizontal axes not comparable).}. As a helpful pointer, note that the
population at the base of the pyramid is expected to decrement within the \textit{next year}, thus the vertical axis can also can also be thought of as year $t+y$, although $e_y$ more clearly identifies the pyramid with year $t$ mortality conditions. The pyramid should not be taken out of context as a forecast. Note that this pyramid represents the exact same
population as an age-classified pyramid: Underlying males sum to the correct total on 
the left and females sum to the correct total on the right. Only the definition of age has
changed; instead of counting forward from birth we count \textit{age} in reverse
starting from death. For individuals, this feat would be impossible, but given
 the information contained in a period lifetable, one can to great utility 
 redistribute population aggregates according to $e_y$\footnote{To undertake
 the same but assuming future mortality changes (improvements) one might
 better undertake a fertility-free cohort component projection and collect the
 deaths from each future year $t+y$ until extinction. This possibility is not
 treated in the present dissertation.}. Both pyramids have been rescaled
 to sum to 100, in order to more comparably represent population structure.

A time series of remaining life expectancy pyramids for any given Western 
country (excluding war years and epidemics, and especially after the rapid fall
in infant mortality) will show incredible stability over time, which is
remarkable in light of ageing in the observed population pyramid. The simple 
interpretation of this kind of pyramid adds to its utility, and this author 
believes that $e_y$-specific population structure, and
indicators that can be derived from this method (not treated here) should 
make up a valuable new component to the contemporary demographer's toolbox, as well 
as help inform current population debates. 

It will suffice for the time being to
illustrate that for Spain and the US in the years trated in this dissertation,
the remaining-years-structured population pyramid has been many times more
stable. This we will demonstrate by again making use of the difference
coefficient, $\theta$ from Equation~\ref{eq:coefdiff}, where $f_1$ is the
population structure for year $t$ and $f_2$ is the population structure from
year $t+1$ (males and females, together, scaled to sum to 1). We iteratively
produce $\theta$, comparing year $t$ and $t+1$ for age-structured pyramids in
the first place and for $e_y$-structured pyramids on the other. Pyramids are in
general very stable, so the difference $\theta$ in both cases will nearly always
fall below 0.02. However, $e_y$-$\theta$ is consistently and considerably lower
than the age-$\theta$. It will suffice to take the ratio of the two indicators,
 $e_y$-$\theta$ divided by age-$\theta$ over the period of study for both
 countries, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:PyramidStability}.

                age-structured populations, year $t$ vs $t+1$, ratio of

         \includegraphics{Figures/PyramidStabilityThetaRatio}
      \label{fig:PyramidStability} 
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:PyramidStability}, a value of 1 would indicate that the two
ways of structuring population are equally stable between years $t$ and $t+1$;
values less than 1 indicate that the $e_y$-structured population is more stable.
For instance, .5 means that the $e_y$-structured population was twice as stable,
.2 means 5 times more stable, and so forth. In all years in this dissertation,
$e_y$-structuring acted to stabilize the population somewhat. As a heuristic,
runs of years with continuous and modest improvements in mortality will produce
the most stable $e_y$-structured pyramids. This measure of stability compounds
as well: that is to say, and $e_y$-structured population in year $t$
compared with that from year $t+10$ will be much more stable than the same
comparison for the standard population. This lesson will reap dividends
throughout the remainder of this dissertation; we will exploit this observation
without investigating much further into its causes.

\paragraph{Uncertainty in $e_y$-structured population pyramids:} One may
reasonably question whether the structure observed in
Figures~\ref{fig:exPyrUS}~and~\ref{fig:exPyrES} is as certain as its graphical
representation would imply-- There are namely no confidence intervals in the
plot, despite the fact that we've used the deaths distribution $d_x$ to
redistribute population counts, and $d_x$ is naturally subject to random
fluctuations. Aside from typical sources of error for population estimates, and
assuming that age in the first place is correctly recorded, we may wish to asses
how much the present population structure could suffer distortion from noise in
$d_x$. 

To answer shed light on this question, the following exercise has been
carried out: 1) for each age of original data, 1000 random deviates were drawn
from the poisson distribution, using the observed death count as the parameter
$\lambda$. 2) Dividing these simulated death counts by observed exposures gives
simulated death rates $\mu_x$. 3) $d_x$ is derived from $\mu_x$ using the HMD
methods protocol. 4) The population is redistributed 1000 times according to the
1000 random $d_x$ disrtibutions. 5) From these simulated population structure,
the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles are extracted from each class of remaining years.
This yields some rough 95\% uncertainty bands.

It happens that uncertainty due to randomness in $d_x$ is so minor in both the
US and Spanish populations that confidence bands on Figure~\ref{fig:exPyrUS}
would not be visible to the naked eye. There is a pattern to uncertainty in
$e_y$-structured populations, however, that we display in
Figure~\ref{fig:PyramidUncertainty}. Confidence bands are larger for the Spanish
population than for the US population due to difference in population size. The
pattern over remaing years is for uncertainty to decrease from the lowest life
expectancies until $e_y$ is around 40 or 50, and then to
increase geometrically until the highest life expectancies. The highest
uncertainty corresponds with the thinnest part of the pyramid, and the lowest
uncertainty falls around the mode of the pyramid. Uncetainties for males and
females is similar in low $e_y$, but tends to become higher for males and
females as $e_y$ increases geometrically.

\paragraph{Potential indicators of ageing implied by this structure: }

The reader will have been quick to notice that the present pyramid lends itself
to the calculation of some simple proportions akin to those offered by
\citet[e.g.][]{sanderson2005average}. For instance, one may calculate the
proportion of the pyramid with remaining life expectancy less than some
threshold, such as 15 (that commonly chosen by Sanderson and Scherbov). Where
$P^T$ is the total population and $P_y$ is the population with exact remaining
life expectancy $y$, we calculate the proportion of the population with 15 or
less remaining years of life expectancy, $P_{y \le 15}$, as
\begin{equation}
P_{y \le 15} = \frac{\int _{j=0}^{y} P_j \dd j}{P^T}
\end{equation}

The results from this calculation will differ from the method called the
``Prospective Old-Age Dependency Ratio''(POADR) for two reasons. 1) POADR is
calculated by indexing the lifetable $e_x$ to some reference
lifetable\footnote{This is explained nicely in \citet{sanderson2007new}}. 2)
we have lost the age information necessary to cut off the total population
below age 20, although this could be accounted for with little trouble. In
doing so, however, we would lose the deaths of all those below age 20 that
would happen within the next 15 years. 

To better compare with the notion of prospective age, look to the example given
in \citet{sanderson2007new}: The authors give the example of comparing
individuals from 1950 and 2000 who each have an average remaining life 
expectancy of 30. These two individuals will 
evidently have had different chronological ages. Imagine that in 1950 $e_x = 30$ 
occured at age 40, and in 2000 at age 50. Then using 1950 as our standard, we 
could say that the 50-year-old in 2000 has a prospective age of 40, in the sense
of ``50 is the new 40''. 

This basis for the method is quite different than that presented here because
indexing is done via the $e_x$ column of the lifetable, which is a weighted
average. Specifically, it is the weighted average of all possible remaining life
expectancies, where $d_x$ are the weights. Chronological age is in this way
never dispensed with, and it is hard to imagine how, for instance, this method
could do a good job of producing a fully structured population, such as that
seen in Figures~\ref{fig:exPyrUS}~and~\ref{fig:exPyrES}. Our method instead
combines ages via $d_x$ so as to arrive at clean breakpoints of $y$. We do not
offer a thorough comparison between such measures, although this is a ripe
avenue for further work.

Another measure of population ageing that falls out of our method is the
Proportion of Life Lived (PLL)\footnote{Again, this idea owes to a
particular conversation with John MacInnes, upon which I formalized the
concept.}. Take, for instance the same 50-year-old man in 2000 with a remaining life expectancy of
30. This person will in the end on average live 80 years, and so has completed
$\tfrac{50}{80} = 0.625$ or 62.5\% of his life. We can refine this a bit further
by using the deaths distribution at ages 50 and higher in 2000; some 50-year-old
males will die at age 50, others at age 51, and so on up until the highest age.
With respect to each potential age of death, we may then calculate a proportion
of life lived, and proceed to take a weighted average of these. Formally, we
calculate PLL for the whole population as

\begin{equation}
PLL = \frac{\int _{y = 0} ^\infty \int _{a = 0} ^\infty \frac{a}{a + y}
\left[ P_a
\frac{d_{a + y} }{ \int _{b = a} ^{\infty} d_b\, \dd b  }\right] \dd a \dd y }{
P^T }
\end{equation}
where $a$ indexes age and $y$ indexes remaining years of life. For the US and
Spain, the time trend of this indicator for our two populations and our
relatively narrow range of years is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:PLL}
\begin{figure}
      \centering
      % Figure made in PyramidStability.R
      \caption{Population proportion of life lived, PLL, US, 1969-2009 and
      Spain, 1975-2009.}
         \includegraphics{Figures/PLL}
      \label{fig:PLL} 
\end{figure}

This trend will be seen to agree roughly with those presented by other
\textit{forward-looking} indicators of ageing. PLL, however, is particularly
intuitive, requiring no involved examples to explain to non-demographers, and
the trend seen here is particularly clear and consistent. One could
calculate PLL in like manner for particular ages, age-ranges, or remaining-years
classes. This indicator will surely yield much lower levels if improvements
are accounted for. This dissertation offers no further discussion of the
potential ageing indicators implied by the present structuring of population.

%\paragraph{Affects of mortality improvement on remaining-years classified

%Expected deaths to the population presently living several decades from the

%change has been one of improvement.
