\chapter{Equation~\ref{eq:lineartwosexrenewal} applied to US and Spanish data}This appendix provides numerical results from the application of theestimation techniques described in Section~\ref{sec:exLotka2linear}. Estimatesof $r^\upsilon$, $T^\upsilon$ and $R_0^\upsilon$ under three values of $\sigma$.Recall that $\sigma$ determines the relative dominance of each sex, where 0 isfemale dominance, 1 is male dominant, and .5 is an intermediate level ofdominance (which is not necessarily an arithmetic mean). As stated in themain text, the border cases where $\sigma = [0,1]$ do not revert to thesingle-sex $e_x$-structured values presented in Section~\ref{sec:exstructuredrenewal} andAppendix~\ref{appendix:exlotka1sex}.\begin{table}  \begin{adjustwidth}{-1in}{-.5in}  \centering    \caption{Two-sex linear intrinsic growth rate, $r^\upsilon$, mean remainingyears of life at reproduction, $T^\upsilon$, and net reproduction,$R_0^\upsilon$, according to renewal Equation~\eqref{eq:lineartwosexrenewal},with $\sigma = [0, .5, 1]$ US, 1969-2009.}    \label{tab:ex2linRepES}        \input{xtables/ex2sexlinearUS.tex}  \end{adjustwidth}\end{table}\begin{table}  \begin{adjustwidth}{-1in}{-.5in}    \centering    \caption{Two-sex linear intrinsic growth rate, $r^\upsilon$, mean remainingyears of life at reproduction, $T^\upsilon$, and net reproduction,$R_0^\upsilon$, according to renewal Equation~\eqref{eq:lineartwosexrenewal}, with$\sigma = [0, .5, 1]$ Spain, 1975-2009.}    \label{tab:ex2linRepES}        \input{xtables/ex2sexlinearES.tex}  \end{adjustwidth}\end{table}
