\todo{Introduce what this chapter is about}

It has been noted that divergence between the sexes, in terms of predicted birth
counts, is often dampened when projected using rates and populations that are
structured according to remaining years. This does not, however, mean that the
problem of the sexes is in this context negligible. Instead, the problem has
only become slightly more tractable. The author considers the problem more
tractable because in decreasing the magnitude of discrepancy between male and female
rates, the trade-offs inherent in the various two-sex solutions offered in the
literature also become smaller. This section will introduce two kinds of two-sex
extensions of the $e_y$-structured population model introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:exstructuredrenewal}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A linear extension, assuming fixed weights for males and female,
  similar in design to the age-structured two-sex model found in
  \citet{goodman1967age}.
  \item A non-linear extension, following the example in
  \citet{gupta1978alternative}.
  \item another non-linear extension? might need to break out sections\ldots
\end{enumerate}
