It has been noted that divergence between the sexes, in terms of predicted birth
counts, is often dampened when projected using rates and populations that are
structured according to remaining years. This does not, however, mean that the
problem of the sexes is in this context negligible. Instead, the problem has
only become slightly more tractable. The author considers the problem more
tractable because in decreasing the magnitude of discrepancy between male and female
rates, the trade-offs inherent in the various two-sex solutions offered in the
literature also become smaller. This chapter will introduce some two-sex
extensions of the $e_y$-structured population model introduced in the earlier
Section~\ref{sec:exstructuredrenewal}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A dominance-weighted extension, assuming fixed weights for males and
  female, similar in design to the age-structured two-sex model found in
  \citet{goodman1967age}.
  \item An extension based on the generalized mean of the joint male-female
  exposures, based on that presented for age-structured populations in
  Section~\ref{sec:ageharmonic}.
  \item A two-sex extension proposed especially for the $e_y$-structured
  two-sex population, based on a constant departure from the association-free
  joint birth distribution. 
\end{enumerate}
