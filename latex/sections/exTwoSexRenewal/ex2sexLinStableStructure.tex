As with the single-sex case, one may measure the distributional distance between
the initial and stable conditions for two-sex $e_y$-structured populations. The
degree of separation, $\theta$, will be intermediate to those calculated for the 
single-sex cases, leaning closer to the male or
female indices depending on the value of $\sigma$ used to calculate the two-sex
stable population. Also as with the single-sex case, the damping
ratio may be calculated from the two-sex $e_y$-structured projection matrix 
presented in Section~\ref{sec:ex2sxprojmat}. Here the value is not
necessarily intermediate to the male and female single-sex cases, as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:damping2}:

Note that in both cases the $\sigma$ used to calculate the two-sex matrices was
.5, in principle \textonehalf~informed by male vital rates and \textonehalf~
informed by female vital rates. For the US, as one might expect, the damping
ratio was intermediate to the single-sex male and female ratios. For
the Spanish population, however, the two-sex model is expected to stabilize
faster than either of the corresponding one-sex models. We speculate that this
will be in large part due to the explicit balancing of the male and female
populations by the sex ratio at birth, which is higher in Spain than in the US. 
In the two-sex model, the Spanish population moves forward as a whole rather 
than quickly diverging due to its high sex ratio. This may be a desirable
property.

Our other summary measure of transient dynamics, the total absolute
oscillation of population structure from the initial to stable states
\citep{cohen1979cumulative}, in this case tends to be intermediate to the male
and female values (see Figure~\ref{fig:cohend22sex}). One exception are the
years 1975-6 for the Spanish population, where total oscillation in his model
would have been higher than for either single-sex model. Recall that the damping
ratio for each year of data was higher (faster stability) for the two-sex case 
than either single-sex case. Only the $\sigma$ value of 0.5 was tested, but here
we see that other values of $\sigma$ also would not guarantee damping ratios or
total oscillations bracketed by the single-sex cases. That we see this in the
simple linear combination of male and female models might be a precursor to
observing that such measures for non-linear models will also not necessarily be
bracketed by the male and female single-sex cases.
