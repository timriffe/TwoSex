The iterative technique described in Section~\ref{sec:schoenexiterative} to
optimize the two-sex $r$ (and the SRB) for the present population model is here
run for each year of data. Detailed results for $r$ and
the stable sex ratio at birth using the harmonic, geometric and logarithmic
means can be found in the tables of Appendix~\ref{appendix:exallrestimates}
alongside those of other remaining-years renewal models. $r$ itself is not 
visually distinguishable in a time series plot from the previous
weighted-dominance model where $\sigma = 0.5$, and so we do not bother to display 
yet another time series of it. The case is
similar for the ultimate two-sex stable population structure.
Equation~\eqref{eq:schoenexcy} can be followed to produce structures that are also very similar to those
previously displayed for the weighted-dominance case where $\sigma = 0.5$.
Neither do we endeavor to measure the transient dynamics of the present model, 
as has been done for the dominance-weighted two-sex model. Instead, in order 
to better grasp the implications of this particular model, we display the
initial versus stable $e_y$-specific fertility rates, $e$SFR, for a pair of years from 
the US and Spanish data. This author has never seen such comparisons done for 
age-classified models, even when equations are given to calculate the stable
TFR.

One aspect of the present model that might not be obvious is that male and
female marginal fertility rates indeed change from the initial state in each time point along
the path to stability, and ultimately differ in the final state from the initial
$e_y$-specific rate vectors. Two aspects of fertility are held constant in the
present model. 1) The initial joint rates calculated on the basic of a given
mean of male and female exposures specific to each combination of remaining
years of life. This matrix is indeed held fixed. 2) The particular mean function
used in the first place to calculate the mean rate matrix is reapplied in each
successive year to the evolving population vectors. As population vectors
oscillate, the ultimate predicted birth count for a particular remaining-years
combination will rise or fall, as will male and female marginal birth count
predictions. The end effect is that the marginal rates themselves are also
different in the initial versus stable states. Figure~\ref{fig:eSFRharmonic}
compares the initial $e$SFR vectors for each sex with their ultimate stable
values for 1975 and 2009 in the US and Spain.

In general, initial rates will differ from stable rates as a function of the
degree of difference in the initial versus stable population structures. Where
initial and stable structures are similar, marginal fertility rates are not
expected to change much, such as 2009 US in Figure~\ref{fig:eSFRharmonic}. What
is constant in the model is the element-wise \textit{interaction} between
remaining years classes of males and females, as captured by a particular mean function.
Here we have used the harmonic mean, but
this can certainly be switched for any other criterion (albeit with little
consequence in our experience). To draw an example from the current figure, note
that marginal rates for 1975 US females are higher in the stable than in the
initial states. This means that females in the stable population are relatively
less abundant than in the initial population. Rates for males in this case must
on average move downward to compensate. This model property applies in like 
manner to the analogous age-classified model
presented earlier in Section~\ref{sec:ageharmonic}.

One can compare the full series of initial versus stable fertility rates by
summing over remaining years within each year to arrive at $e$TFR, and then
taking the difference between stable and initial $e$TFR. The results of this
exercise are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:eTFRharmonic}. As one might expect,
the male and female $e$TFR differences mirror each other approximately. These
differences are due primarily to changes in the sex structure between the initial and stable
states, and since fertility rates are calculated on the mean of male and female
exposures, male and female $e$TFR will be pulled in opposite directions. The
magnitude of the difference between initial and stable TFR under this model
definition has on the whole been decreasing over time, and it has typically been
smaller for the US population than for the Spanish population.
