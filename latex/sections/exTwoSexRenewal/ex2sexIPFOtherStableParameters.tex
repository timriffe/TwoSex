Having estimates the two-sex $r$ and $\varsigma$, one may proceed to estimate
other quantities of interest in the stable population. $T$ and $R_0$ may be
calculated directly, replacing the estimates $\widehat{T}$ and $\widehat{R_0}$
used in the previous iterative procedure. The only difference in these formulas 
will be that the variable $\varsigma$ is in its stable state, as $r$ is not
used, and so these values will not change by much. Perhaps more interesting will
be the stable population structure, which we briefly describe in following.
First calculate the stable 2-sex birth rate, $b$:
\begin{equation}
b = \Bigg[ \frac{1}{2}\Bigg( \int _{y=0}^\infty 
  \int_{a=0}^\infty \varsigma e^{-ra}d_{a+y} \dd a \dd y \;+\;
  \int _{y'=0}^\infty  \int_{a'=0}^\infty
(1-\varsigma) e^{-ra'}d_{a'+y'} \dd a' \dd y'\Bigg)
\Bigg]^{-1}
\end{equation}
and with this calculate the male and female stable $e_y$-structures, $c_y$ and
$c_{y'}$:
\begin{align}
c_y &= b\varsigma \int _{y=0}^\infty 
  \int_{a=0}^\infty \varsigma^i e^{-ra}d_{a+y} \dd a \dd y \\
c_{y'} &= b(1-\varsigma) \int _{y'=0}^\infty 
  \int_{a'=0}^\infty \varsigma^i e^{-ra'}d_{a'+y'} \dd a' \dd y'
\end{align}
Of course $1 = \int c_y + \int c_{y'}$. With the stable structures, we may
calculate the stable population sex ratio, $\bar{S}$:
\begin{equation}
\bar{S} = \frac{\int_{y=0}^\infty c_y \dd y}{\int_{y'=0}^\infty c_{y'} \dd y'}
\end{equation}
or the stable proportions above, below or between some given age threshold(s).

Also of interest are the stable male and female marginal fertility rates, which
differ from but depend on the original marginal fertility rates, $f_y$
and $f_{y'}$, which are also present in the last iteration of the $r$
estimation procedure described previously, but may also be regenerated using
$c_y$ and $c_{y'}$:
\begin{align}
b_{y,y'} = IPF(\tau, c^m, c^f)
\intertext{where $c^m$ and $c^f$ are the entire vectors of $e_y$ stable
population structure, $\tau$ stands for the three \textit{standards} used (the
observed birth matrix and male and female marginal rates), and $b_{y,y'}$ stands
for all $y,y'$ combinations of predicted births and is not to be confused with the stable two-sex birth rate, $b$.} f_y = \frac{\int _{y'=0}^\infty b_{y,y'} \dd y'}{c_y}\\ f_{y'} = \frac{\int _{y=0}^\infty b_{y,y'} \dd y}{c_{y'}}
\end{align}
$f_y$ and $f_{y'}$ are potentially of interest in their own right, as a
consequence of the present model, and will also be explored somewhat when we
apply this method to the US and Spanish data in following.
