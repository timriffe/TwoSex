\label{sec:ipfex}
Recall the curious finding from Section~\ref{sec:exobsexpected} that the
probable joint distribution of births by remaining years of mothers and fathers is typically
very similar to the association-free distribution of the same. This trait
appears to lend itself to the two-sex method presented in Section~\ref{sec:IPF},
namely iterative proportion fitting, IPF. The properties of remaining-years birth 
distributions prove advantageous for IPF because 1) initial and year
$t+n$ population $e_y$-structures differ by much less than the age-structures,
and 2) since observed and joint $e_y$ distributions are close to their own
association-free distributions, the fact that IPF preserves cross-product ratios
seems less arbitrary than was the case for age joint distributions. That IPF
maintains inter-age competition and substitutability seems not to be as key in
the remaining-years perspective as it is in the age-perspective because we suppose
that couples are less selective with respect to remaining years of life than is
the case with years since birth.
