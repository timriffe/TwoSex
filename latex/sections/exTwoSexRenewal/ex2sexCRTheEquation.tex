The present method works as follows: Take constant base male and female
$e_y$-specific fertility rates. Given these rates and a male and female
$e_y$-structured population, we can generate the male and female predictions of
birth counts. We know from Section~\ref{sec:exdivergence} that the male and
female total counts will tend to differ by less than if we were to repeat the
same for age-structured populations. However, the two total counts will still
differ, and so cannot be taken directly as the marginal birth count distributions from
which to calculate the association-free bivariate distribution (the denominator
in Equation~\eqref{eq:expected}). To generate the expected count matrix, we
therefore calculate the cross-product of the male and female predictions and
divide by a mean of the male and female total predictions as follows:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}(B_{y,y'}) = \frac{\widehat{B_y} \widehat{B_{y'}}}{M(\int \widehat{B_y} \dd y,
\int \widehat{B_{y'}} \dd y')}
\end{equation}
