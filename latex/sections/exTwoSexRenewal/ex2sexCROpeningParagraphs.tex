The present section is motivated by the desire for a non-linear two-sex model of
$e_y$-structured population growth that takes advantage of the observation that
the observed joint distribution of births by remaining years of fathers 
and mothers, $B_{y,y'}$, is in our experience very close to the expected
distribution, taking the male and female marginals as given. We have noted 
that the overall distributional distance
between observed and expected counts is typically very small (see e.g.
Figure~\ref{fig:TotalVarobsexpex}), but we have not described any patterns that
may exist in the difference between these two distributions. There is indeed a
common pattern to the departure between the observed and expected distributions
of $e_y$ structured births. \todo{show this pattern in Figure in appendix?} 

The method presented here will thus stay true to the stable population concept
 of fixed male and female $e_y$-specific fertility rates, but will add a second
 fixed component, a constant \textit{ratio} between $B_{y,y'}$ and
 $\mathbb{E}(B_{y,y'})$, which will be used as an adjustment instrument, in
 effect providing flexibility in the male and female marginal rates, while forcing
 consistency (via a mean expected count matrix), both in the total birth count
 and in the $e_y$-distribution of births. The method to be presented here will be shown to posses
 several desirable properties for two-sex models.
