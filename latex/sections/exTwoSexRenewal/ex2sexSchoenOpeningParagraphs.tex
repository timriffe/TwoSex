One may also take a more interactive approach to the two-sex
problem than is the case for the weighted-dominance case, which relies
on fixed marginals and a fixed dominance parameter. In this section we
translate the two-sex method first presented in Section~\ref{sec:ageharmonic}
to the remaining years case. This method allows the fertility of each sex to
vary from year to year according to a given mean function of the joint male-female remaining-years 
fertility distribution determined in the initial year according to the same
mean function. That is to say, the model described here incorporates a certain
degree of model feedback due to changes in the sex ratios of male and females in
each remaining years class.
