One can also take a more interactive approach to the two-sex
problem than that presented for the weighted-dominance case. The latter relied
on fixed male and female marginal fertility rates and a fixed dominance
parameter. In this section we translate the two-sex method first presented in Section~\ref{sec:ageharmonic}
to the remaining-years case. This method allows the fertility of each sex to
vary from year to year according to a given mean function of the joint male-female remaining-years 
fertility distribution as determined in the initial year according to the same
mean function. That is to say, the model described here incorporates a certain
degree of internal feedback due to changes in the sex ratios of male and females
in each remaining-years class.
