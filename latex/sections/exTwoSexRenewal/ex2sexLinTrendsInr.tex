This procedure has been applied to the data from the US and Spain with $\sigma$
given the values of 0, 0.5 and 1, which correspond to the cases of
female-dominace, an intermediate value, and male-dominance, 
and can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rupsilonlinear2sex}
\footnote{The data in Figure~\ref{fig:rupsilonlinear2sex} are available in
    Tables~\ref{tab:ex2linRepES}~and~\ref{tab:ex2linRepUS} of
    Appendix~\ref{appendix:ex2sexlinear}, along with the stable parameters
    $R_0^\upsilon$ and $T^\upsilon$.}

Patterns accord with trends generally known from the age-classified $r^f$ and
$r^m$, but values of $r^\upsilon$ are higher than the
age-classified intrinsic growth rates in all of the years studied. In all years
tested here, $r^\upsilon$ was indeed bounded by the $e_x$-structured $r^f$ and $r^m$. There have been some notable crossovers in
which was the greater $r^\upsilon$ derived from the border cases of $\sigma = 0$
and  $\sigma = 1$. Notably, in the US male dominance produced a higher
$r^\upsilon$ than female dominance from the start of observation until
1985, after which time there was a crossover that has persisted. Spain has
undergone two such crossovers, with female dominace producing a higher
$r^\upsilon$ than male dominace until 1980, and again recently starting in 2007.
Note that the spread between the border cases of male and female dominance is
tighter than between the single-sex cases. This observation should put the
demographer at ease in deciding the degree of dominance to assign via $\sigma$,
and makes it particularly easy to accept an intermediate value such as $.5$.
There have been series of years in both the US and Spain where swapping dominace
would have made virtually no difference in results or conclusions!
