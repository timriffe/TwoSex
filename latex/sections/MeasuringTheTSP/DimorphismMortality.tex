Sexual dimorphism in mortality is of primary significance to human reproduction.
Parents must survive in order to parent, and children must survive in order to
become parents. This later element, survival until reproductive ages, enters
directly into canoncial indicators such as the Net Reproduction Rate. Parental
survival does not, to the knowledge of this author, enter into indicators of
population reproductivity, except in the less-iluminating
sense that parents must survive in order to progress birth parities. This section will briefly present 
some novel methods and indicators for weighing mortality into measures of
reproductivity.
