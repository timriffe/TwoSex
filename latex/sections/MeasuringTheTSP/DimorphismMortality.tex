Sexual dimorphism in mortality is of primary significance to human reproduction.
Parents must survive in order to parent, and children must survive in order to
become parents. This later element, survival until reproductive ages, enters
directly into summary indicators such as the intrinsic growth rate, NRR or
Fisher's reproductive value. Thus, differences in survival will also account for
part of the gap between male and female reproductivity, and are worth summarizing in light of sex-differences
that may contribute to sex divergence in population models.

Life expectancy at birth, $e_0$, is a synthetic indicator interpreted as the
average years that would be lived by the members of a cohort of individuals if
the mortality conditions of the present year were to be repeated each year until extinction of
the cohort. Sexual dimorphism in vital rates is commonly summarized using the
gap in $e_0$, in this case $e_0^F - e_0^M$, since female life expectancy tends
to be higher. For the data used in this dissertation, the gap is as displayed in
Figure~ref{fig:e0gap}

The gap in Figure~\ref{fig:e0gap} is amenable to various kinds of decomposition.
Such analyses have been done for Spain by age and cause\citep[pp 217-218 and
447]{amand2007thesis}. Blanes shows that over the period studied, the main cause of death components to the
gap in Spain were roughly the same over the period studied: cancers, heart
and circulatory disease, lung disease. The hump in the middle of
Figure~\ref{fig:e0gap} for Spain is due to male excess mortality from external
causes, traffic accidents, ``other malignant tumors'' and AIDs, but it has
since declined. The gap component due to congential conditions has also
decreased steadily over the entire period studied. Ages 40-80 account for the
majority of the gap over the whole period.

\todo{Find decomp of $e_0$-gap in USA, describe briefly}

$e_0$ is just the sum of the survival function when $l_0 = 1$, where the
negative unit change in the survival function gives the death distribution,
$d_x$, and the ratio of these gives the mortality hazard, $\mu _x$. $\mu_x$ does
not depend on what happens in other ages, whereas $l_x$ and $d_x$ do. Thus the
most informative age-decomposition of $e_0$ should be based on differences in
$\mu _x$, whereas the most informative comparison of the overal shape of
survival, as it might pertain to the differences in measures of reproduction
will be of overlap in the $l_x$ or $d_x$ distributions. We examine
sex-differences in the deaths distribution using $d_x$ simply
because it already sums to 1, which makes for simpler use of
equation~\eqref{eq:coefdiff}. Thus the proportion of the two distributions that
is not in common, $\theta$ is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:dxtheta}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\end{figure}

From Figure~\ref{fig:dxtheta} we see that for the US, as the sex-specific $d_x$
distributions have approached each other, the sex-gap in $e_0$ from the previous
Figure~\ref{fig:e0gap} has also narrowed. Likewise, for Spain, these two trends
have been roughly, but not entirely synchronized. The remainder of the gap, the
part not explained by the trend in Figure~\ref{fig:dxtheta}, will be due to the
particular ages in which $d_x$-differences were observed, as $e_0$ may also be
conceived of as the $d_x$-weighted average of the ages in which persons died. We
will not investigate further into the age contributions that have led to this
gap, but will be content for now to note that, in general, the
contribution of mortality to the magnitude of the two sex problem in the US will
have declined over the period studied here, while for Spain it tended to
increase into the 1990s and has since tapered off. In following we will conduct
a proper decomposition of the gap in intrinsic growth rates that will put the
present and preceeding sections on dimorphism in vital rates in its context.
