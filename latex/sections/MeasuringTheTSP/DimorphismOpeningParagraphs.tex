Divergence between single-sex population models has been shown to be a problem
of both theoretical and practical significance for demographers, and it stems from
the fact that vital rates almost always differ between the sexes.
This characteristic of human populations, sexual dimorphism in vital rates,
is manifest in all subfields of demography. In following, we will use the term
sexual dimorphism, which enters into the present discussion via evolutionary
demography and biology\footnote{See, e.g. \citet{caswell1986two} for a paper
relevant to the present dissertation where the term \textit{dimorphism} is used
in the same way.}, to refer to sex differentiation, specifically with respect to demographic forces-- vital rates.In observed populations, fluctuations in vital rates are constantly underway, and can either magnify or 
diminish differences between single-sex intrinsic growth rates (or predicted births). 
In population models, dimorphism is relevant as it pertains to fertility and mortality 
rates, as well as the sex ratio at birth.

This section is exploratory and descriptive in nature. We seek here to
demonstrate 1) major differences between male and female rates and 2) the fact
that these gaps can and do change over time. We only touch upon rates that might
be relevant to the two-sex problem. The subsequent section~\ref{sec:dimorphASFR}
will quantify the contribution of the vital rates treated here to the size of the two-sex
problem.
