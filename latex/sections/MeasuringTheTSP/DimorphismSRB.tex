Clearly another major factor contributing to divergence between the single sex
male and female stable population models will be non-parous sex ratios at birth.
Since sex ratios at birth are typically greater than one, ceterus paribum, males
are given a greater $l_0$. To a certain extent, this advantage in $l_0$ is
offset by greater attrition due to excess male mortality. In this way, effective
sex ratios in reproductive ages can be ambiguously greater than or less than 1,
depending both on the sex ratio at birth and mortality conditions. The
single-sex Lotka Equation~\eqref{eq:lotkaeq} does not incorporate a third
variable for the sex ratio at birth, since we assume that rates can be
calculated separately by sex of birth. Equation~\eqref{eq:lotkaeq} could be
modified to incorporate such a variable, say where $\varsigma$ is
$\tfrac{1}{1+SRB}$ for females and $\tfrac{SRB}{1+SRB}$ for males, and $m_a$
becomes either male or female ASFR:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lotkaeqSRB}
1 = \int _0 ^\infty e^{-ra}p_a \varsigma_a m_a \dd a 
\end{equation}

In Equation~\eqref{eq:lotkaeqSRB}, the sex ratio at birth is not be assumed
constant over age of mother or father, since SRB is known to decrease with age.
Figure~\ref{fig:SRB1975} demonstrates the age pattern (i.e. age of mother or
father) for the US and Spain in 1975.

Clearly the age pattern to sex ratio at birth is susceptible to random
fluctuations. However, since the age-specific vector $\varsigma _a$ is summed
over age in~\eqref{eq:lotkaeqSRB}, these fluctuations are smoothed out, and in
fact, results will be identical to those from \eqref{eq:lotkaeq}. That there is
an age pattern to the sex ratio at birth makes evident that the total sex ratio 
at birth is nother more than a weighted
average of the age-specific sex ratios at birth. Since in any projection, or
virtual projection (as in the case of the stable population model) the initial
and final population structure will differ, one should not blindly assume or
force a constant SRB valid for both the initial and stable states\footnote{This
later condition was the basis of the two-sex stable population model presented in
\citet{mitra1982alternative,mitra1978derivation,mitra1976effect}, and is in the
opinion of this author an unreasonable condition.}.

Aside from random fluctuations, especially evident in the oldest and youngest
ages, the age-pattern of SRB undergoes subtle changes over time. Further, there
are interactions in SRB by age of mother and age of father (these later two
also being marginal distributions). These are aspects that may also be
considered if models rely upon fertility rates cross-classified by age of mother
and father. Therefore, to the extent that there is a trend over time in the SRB
(see Figure~\ref{fig:SRByears}), part of this will owe to changes in the
age-patterns of fertility.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\end{figure}

Note that there has been a general downward trend in the SRB in both Spain and
the United States in the period studied, that Spain has had a
higher\footnote{The difference between the US and Spain is also significant, not
shown.} SRB, peaking at over 1.09 in 1981, but falling precipitously ever since. Since Spain is a
smaller population, the series is much more volatile, but the trend is
nonetheless clear in both countries. It is particularly relevant to note that
the assumption of a constant SRB of 1.05 in population projections in Spain
would have been and still would be very far from observed values, and would 
affect the resulting population structure. This is relevant not
just for two-sex models\footnote{Two-sex models are, however, especially advised
to take special care with the SRB.}, but also for standard female-dominant
projections, which treat males as a residual, splitting births based on some
assumption about the SRB.

This section is about dimorphism. It is argued that the sex ratio at birth
is both a sort of dimorphism in fertility, but is especially relevant for
dimorphism in the sex structure of populations, since male and female survival
cruves are subject to differing radices.
