The main aspects of vital rates that contribute to the two-sex problem have by
now been illustrated, as has the maginitude of the problem both in terms of
intrinsic growth rates and separate predictions of births. The primary factors
contributing to differences in $r$ have been indicated as mortality, fertility
and the sex ratio at birth. This section takes the extra step of breaking
down and quantifying differences between $r^m$ and $r^f$ into consituent parts
for fertility, mortality and the sex ratio at birth. 

The exercise carried out is as follows: Equation~\eqref{eq:lotkaeqSRB} has been
functionalized and applied to the US and Spanish data for males and females,
with $r$ estimated using the method of \citet{coale1957new}. We decompose using the
pseudo-continuous method outlined in \citet{horiuchi2008decomposition}.
