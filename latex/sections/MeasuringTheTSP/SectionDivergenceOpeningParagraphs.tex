\label{sec:Divergence}
``Divergence'' here refers to two or more quantities growing farther and
farther apart with the passing of time-- quantities that have different
trajectories or speeds, branching, say. The quantities diverging in this way are
the male and female total populations, when modelled separately. Specifically, we refer to
the male and female stable populations, a product of vital rates,
theoretically removed from reference to real population counts. It is therefore
sufficient to speak of changes in the relative size of the male and female
populations, and further sufficient to speak of the
difference in the rate of change of these two populations, which is constant in
the limit. The intrinsic rate of increase in the Lotka model is $r$, and the
rate of separation between males and females can be captured in the difference
between the male and female rates, $r^m$ and $r^f$, respectively.
