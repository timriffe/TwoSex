\subsection{General Equilibrium Models}
% cite Lam and Sanderson
The balancing of marriages (births) has also been treated using economic models
in the General Equilibrium family of models \citep{}. The underlying
link between a marriage market and this otherwise out-of-place sounding model
family is that while effective numbers of available males and females may
change, and each will have its own utility function for mating, the number of
marriages (births) is always equal for both males and females, i.e. and
equilibrium is always found. and the two-sided supply and demand system that
arises

 each individual with a
personal set of \textit{scores} for potential partners
