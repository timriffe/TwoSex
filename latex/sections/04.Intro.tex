\todo{Intro in development!}Before using the term at length, we offer a quick definition of the two-sexproblem:\begin{singlespace}\begin{quote}The \textbf{two-sex problem}: Separate male and female predictions of eventswill differ when 1) the events depend on both sexes, 2) the same events form the numerators of the rates of each sex that are used in the prediction and3) the exposures used to calculate these same rates change from year to year(time to time). We would like a single prediction based on information from thedemographic rates of each sex.\end{quote}\end{singlespace} Such events include heterosexual marriages and the vast majority of births. A manifestation of this problem in formal demography is that the male and female single-sex renewal models calculated from the data of any observed  population will diverge from one another, and therefore neither can represent the population as a whole. Models that account for the rates of both sexes so as to produce a single and consistent result or prediction are variously referred to throughout this dissertation as two-sex \textit{methods}, two-sex \textit{solutions}, two-sex \textit{rate balancing}, two-sex  \textit{adjustments}, and so on with no strict distinction between terms.  The two-sex problem in human demography has until this work either been defined  and studied for populations that are structured by sex only, for populationsstructured by both sex and age, or for populations structured by age, sex andmarital status. The problem enjoys a long history in formal demography, and mostcontemporary applied demographers likely have a rough idea of what the problemis, but it is not at the forefront of the consciousness of most contemporarypracticing demographers. For this reason we dedicate a sizeable portion of this dissertation, Chapter~\ref{ch:Measuring}, to defining, describing anddecomposing the two-sex problem for populations structured by age and sex. Theprimary (and likely original) contribution of this chapter is the decompositionof the sex-gap in intrinsic growth rates into various vital rate components of the classic renewal model. This effort will convince the reader that the two-sexproblem is worth thinking about and accounting for, and it justifies a largeportion of this dissertation.These activities are carried out formally in the context of the fundamentalLotka equations for single-sex population renewal and empirically on the basis US and Spanish data from the past four decades. The choice to work with the two-sex problem inrenewal models is not an idle endeavor, as the practice of projectingpopulation-- the bread and butter of applied demographers-- is grounded inmodels of population renewal. That is to say, in implementing a population projection, one always has a renewal model in mind, and all indices ofpopulation reproductivity refer to a notion of renewal. The methodsdescribed herein are applicable as-is to implementation in populationprojections.We suppose that part of the reason why practicingdemographers often do not account for the two-sex problem in projections (and elsewhere) is that formal demographers have been unable to supply aconsensus solution on how to deal with it. Of course, the lack of consensus ondemographic methods is no obstacle for demographers in other tasks-- there are different ways to calculate lifetables, different ways to estimate exposures,different ways to smooth or graduate demographic schedules, and so forth, butthis does not stop demographers from. Unfortunately there is nobest and true method to account for the two-sex problem in renewal models or projections; there are only approximations. For this reason inChapter~\ref{sec:modellingapproaches} we present a suite of approaches applicable to the US and Spanish example data used thoughout this work. These methods are evaluated in situ. The selection oftwo-sex methods examined is not exhaustive, but has been selected onan ad hoc basis of convenience broadcomparison is done in the context of stable population renewal. Some of these methods will be modified from their original context. The two-sex problem has never beenexplored for the case of populations structured by remaining years of life (thanatological age). This is necessarily so because Lotka's renewal model has never been translated to the case of populations structured by thanatological age, and this latter endeavor banks on the ability to structure a population by thanatological age in the first place.\section{Data}\input{sections/other/Data.tex}
