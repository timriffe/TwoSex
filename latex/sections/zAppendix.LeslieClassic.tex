\chapter{Construction of the standard one-sex Leslie matrix}
\label{Appendix:Caswell}
The Leslie matrix is a tool used for age-structured cohort component population
projections. Here we present the elements that correspond to a simple one-sex
age-structured population. More details on each point presented here can be
found in \cite{caswell2001matrix}.

Say we have a population with $n$ age-classes. Call the vector of age-specific
population counts $\textbf{p}$
