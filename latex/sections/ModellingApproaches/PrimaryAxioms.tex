 \FloatBarrierIt has been pointed out that the ideal functional form of a two-sex solutioncannot be empirically determined (Das Gupta, Schoen, Keyfitz, others). This isbecause fertility is always undergoing secular changes, to the effect thatone cannot simply calibrate an ideal mean function (if a mean function were thecorrect choice) net of outright both-sex fertility change. This we observe aboveall with the Spanish data used in this dissertation: from 1975 until the mid1990s fertility levels dropped so rapidly that in most cases the year $t+1$brith count fell below that which would have been predicted by the year $t$male or female rates-- even as the gap between male andfemale total fertility rates was rather wide in those years. Even in lessextreme situations, where the year $t+1$ birth count is intermediate to that which wouldhave been predicted by the male and female year $t$ rates one is ubable toseparate the effects of relative changes in male versus female exposure fromsimple changes in rates. That is to say, if there is some push and pull betweenmale and female rates, this cannot be measured if rates on the whole are eitherrising or falling-- just as it is difficult to measure the net rising andfalling of rates when there is feedback and separation between male and femalerates. Even if one had a very large amount of data conformable to this problemand an appropriate statistical technique so as to mete out these differences and estimate a function that could separate and capture the effects of ourimagined push and pull between male and female rates, it would be easy to suppose that this ideal function might itself change according to certainconditions or certain periods.This empirical obstacle has led demographers to devise a set of axioms,necessary characteristics, that the ideal function should abide by in order that it coform with ourexpectations. Here we will enumerate all such axioms located in the literaturebefore briefly discussing them in turn. Here, $M()$ is any function thatdetermines the both-sex rate using male, $P^m$, and female, $P^f$, exposures asinputs. These exposures may be classified by some other variable, such as age, butsubscripts are ignored here unless pertinent.\begin{description}  \item[Availability:] $M(P^m, P^f) = 0$ if $P^m = 0$ or $P^f = 0$. Members of  both sexes must be present in order for there to be a non-zero positive rate.  \item[Homogeneity:] $kM(P^m, P^f) = M(kP^m, kP^f)$. Equal  changes in the supply of males and females must lead to an equal change in the  number of births (marriages).  \item[Monotonicity:] for $k > 1$, $M(kP^m, P^f) \ge M(P^m, P^f)$ (and vice  versa). If the supply of one sex increases while the other sex is held constant, the number of  borths (marriages) cannot decrease.  \item[Competition:] if exposure in age $x$ for males is increased by some  factor, but all other male and female ages are held constant, monotonicity  applies to age $x$ of males, but rates for ages $<x$ or $>x$ may only decrease  or say the same. In this case, ages closer to $x$ should be more affected than  ages farther from $x$. Females rates for all ages combined with male age $x$  may only increase or stay the same.  \item[Bracketing:] $M(P^m, P^f) > min(F^m, F^f)$ and $M(P^m, P^f) < max(F^m,  F^f)$. The both-sex rate must be intermediate to the single-sex rates.  \item[Proportionality in the extreme:] in situations of very extreme sex-ratio  imbalance, changes in the amount of the minority sex should be reflected proportionately  in the two-sex rate.\end{description}These axioms will now be briefly reflected upon in turn.\paragraph{Availability:} This is the most elemental axiom, as it essentiallystates a truism: If one sex is absent, there can be no reproduction in a speciesthat reproduces sexually. For the sake of philosophical completeness, we statethe following: 1) Assisted reproduction requires both sexes, so this is noretort; 2) At present, technology that would negate this axiom, humanparthenogenesis, is not fully developed, although ther have been recentadvances\citep{revazova2007patient}. If and when technology would permit asexualhuman reproduction, there will be legal hurdles, costs, and apoption lag. That is to say, potential anecdotes that would negate this axiomwill in any case not affect fertility rates in a significant way within the timehorizons that demographers currently project. This is not a tongue-in-cheekobservation, as technology in general is known to affect fertility in myriadways. For instance, in vitro fertilization and other forms of assistedreproduction have had noticeable effects in the fertility and sex ratio at birth from particularage groups.\paragraph{Homogeneity:} This author finds the axiom of homogeneity to be on thewhole harmless, but not necessarily true. Homogeneity essentially states thatthere are no scaling effects. It is easy to imagine that population size willconstrain or determine much of what happens within populations. This isespecially so when we think in terms of social organization, contactopportunities and the countless other structural factors that may affect thepractice of mating and by extension fertility. Population size has beengiven more attention in non-human ecology \citep{donalson1999population} than inhuman demography, where considerations of population size have been primarily framed in terms ofcarrying-capacities \citep[see e.g.][]{cohen1995human,hopfenberg2003human}. Thisauthor is only aware of scaling in demographic process when studied as complex systems viaagent based modelling (ABM) \citep[e.g.][]{bruch2010scaling}. While ABMs havebeen used to studying fertility and marriage \citep{billari2002wedding},indirect scaling effects in such models have not been explicitly studied, nothave scaling effects been in introduced explicitly.\paragraph{Monotonicity}: this may seem intuitive, but if viewed from asociological standpoint (i.e. a more complex model about how things work), it seems plausible that increasedcompetition could actually lead to a decrease in total births (marriages)Bracketing: the two-sex instrinsic growth rate, $r$, must fall between the maleand female single-sex intrinsic growth rates, $r^m$, $r^f$, respectivelyin instances of very large imbalances in the sex ratio, increases in the supplyof the minority sex lead to proportional increases in the number of marriages\todo{Feeney, Pollak, McFarland, Schoen define more}
