 \FloatBarrierIt has been pointed out that the ideal functional form of a two-sex solutioncannot be empirically determined (Das Gupta, Schoen, Keyfitz, others). This isbecause fertility is always undergoing secular changes, to the effect thatone cannot simply calibrate an ideal mean function (if a mean function were thecorrect choice) net of outright both-sex fertility change. This we observe aboveall with the Spanish data in this dissertation: from 1975 until the mid 1990sfertility levels dropped so rapidly for males and females both that in mostyears the year $t+1$ fertility fell outside the bounds of either sex of the year$t$ fertility. This was observed even though the gap between male and femaletotal fertility was rather wide in those years. Even if secular fertility changewere slight enough, and the sex gap in fertility wide enough, as to virtuallyalways be bracketed by male and female rates, one could not faithfully separatethe effects of relative changes in exposure from changes in rates.Monotonicity: if the supply of one sex increases while the other sex is heldconstant, the number of marriages cannot decrease, and vice versa [this mayseem intuitive, but if viewed from a sociological standpoint (i.e. a morecomplex model about how things work), it seems plausible that increasedcompetition could actually lead to a decrease in total births (marriages)]Homogeneity: equal changes in the supply of males and females must lead to anequal change in the number of marriages. [my stance: this is the same as sayingthere are no scaling effects, and I find it an excessive andcapricious condition.]Availability: this is a no-brainerCompetition: there are different aspects to this axiom. 1) if exposure in oneage increases, holding other ages constant, events may increaseBracketing: the two-sex instrinsic growth rate, $r$, must fall between the maleand female single-sex intrinsic growth rates, $r^m$, $r^f$, respectivelyin instances of very large imbalances in the sex ratio, increases in the supplyof the minority sex lead to proportional increases in the number of marriages\todo{Feeney, Pollak, McFarland, Schoen define more}
