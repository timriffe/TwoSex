 \FloatBarrierIt has been pointed outMonotonicity: if the supply of one sex increases while the other sex is heldconstant, the number of marriages cannot decrease, and vice versa [this mayseem intuitive, but if viewed from a sociological standpoint (i.e. a morecomplex model about how things work), it seems plausible that increasedcompetition could actually lead to a decrease in total births (marriages)]Homogeneity: equal changes in the supply of males and females must lead to anequal change in the number of marriages. [my stance: this is the same as sayingthere are no scaling effects, and I find it an excessive andcapricious condition.]Availability: this is a no-brainerCompetition: there are different aspects to this axiom. 1) if exposure in oneage increases, holding other ages constant, events may increaseBracketing: the two-sex instrinsic growth rate, $r$, must fall between the maleand female single-sex intrinsic growth rates, $r^m$, $r^f$, respectivelyin instances of very large imbalances in the sex ratio, increases in the supplyof the minority sex lead to proportional increases in the number of marriages\todo{Feeney, Pollak, McFarland, Schoen define more}
