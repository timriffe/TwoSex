This author classifies into a single group those models that have balanced the
male and female single-sex models while adhering to the concept of single-sex
fertility. In this group we could first place the exceedingly simple solution
that consists in taking some mean of the male and female intrinsic growth rates,
$M(r^m, r^f)$ to produce a both-sex $r$, without digging into the model itself.
