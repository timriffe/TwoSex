All two-sex solutions presented thus far in this dissertation have been shown in
terms of rate and data schedules commensurable with lifetable methods and meant
for rather finely graded empirical application. \citet{marriage1981warren,
sanderson1983two} sought a more parsimonious parameterization of the two-sex
problem, akin to the well-known and (extremely) parsimonious 3-parameter
Coale-McNeil model for estimating single-sex marriage
\citep{coale1972distribution, coale1971age}

* 13 \textit{easily interpretable} parameters
