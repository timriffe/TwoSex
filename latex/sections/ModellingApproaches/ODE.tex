Most recent advances on the two-sex problem in the past 15 years have come from
mathematicians and epidemiologists in need of modelling sexual mixing in
populations to study the spread of disease-- most prominently HIV. This family
of models has entered into territory seldom formally considered by practicing
demographers, for instance adding a logistic limiting of growth or pair
formation rather than assuming exponential growth \citep{castillo1995logistic}.
