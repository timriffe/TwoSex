The age-structured pyramid shifts upward by 1 year with
each passing year, with some decrement occurring in each age of life, such that
the essential shape, primarily the fruit of past fertility\footnote{Credit is
owed to Kirk Scott for first imparting me with this heuristic.}, takes two or
more generations to be erased from memory\footnote{Credit is
owed to Anna Cabre for first imparting me with this heuristic.}. Births from the
age structured population fall to the bottom of the pyramid, and are grouped 
together into a cohort. This cohort is heterogenous with respect to future 
age (year) at death, but is
homogenous with respect to the year of birth. We are familiar with
the way the age-structured population model unfolds, as it
reflects both our experience of life and history of demography.
