By now it has been demonstrated that the vital rates corresponding to an
$e_x$-structured population have a different overall shape and behavior from
those that belong to age-structured populations. This is because 1) $e_x$-classified rates
are calculated over the entire population, 2) $e_x$ fertility rates respond to
both fertility and mortality changes, 3) the underlying $e_x$-structured
population ranges close to its ultimate stable form, which means that
the effects of population structure are typically minor and never abrupt. This
later point will be demonstrated in greater depth later in this dissertation.

One may conceive of reproduction in an $e_x$-structured population without
periodic reversion to the familar ground of age-structured populations.
Intuitively, imagine the two varieties of pyramid that correspond to the
(closed) population in question.
