Population projections rarely incorporate males into fertility assumptions. This
assumption, that fertility depends only on females, is called female-dominance,
and in Chapter~\ref{ch:Measuring} we have shown that female dominance is not an
innocuous assumption. In Chapter~\ref{sec:modellingapproaches} we set out to provide a
suite of standard working examples of solutions of two-sex adjustment methods 
so that methods may be compared and implemented by the demographer if desired.
This is a practical concern that has implications on the way
contemporary demography is practiced, albeit within the familiar framework of
age-structured populations. In the following section we provide some
guidance by recommending from among the methods presented.

In changing the definition of population struture, however, we
