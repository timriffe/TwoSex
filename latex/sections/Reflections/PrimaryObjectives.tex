In this dissertation we have aimed to investigate and compare models of
population growth. This we have done in the traditional way, modelling populations structured by
both age and sex in Part 1. We then replaced age-structure with remaining-years
structure for population renewal modes in Parts 2 and 3. Remaining-years
structure is a new idea, and so the implications for the practice of demography are many. Part
2 laid the groundwork for a demography using remaining-years
structure, and then reformulated the canonical single-sex model of population
growth under this new structure. A guiding principle has been that
population renewal models thoughtfully incorporate both sexes. 

Only a single step is required to incorporate chronological age versus
thanatological age in a population renewal model. There are many ways to incorporate both sexes
into the fertility component of a population renewal model, and so the 
two-sex component requires great consideration under either
variety of age-structure. The consideration of two-sex solutions has occupied
the majority of this dissertation, and explains the first part of 
the title: ``the two-sex problem''. The primary
novelty of this dissertation, however, as been to do demography in general, and
model population renewal in specific, using thanatologically structured
demographic data. Part 3 rounded out our investigation by producing two-sex
models under this new structure. We have concluded that the same two-sex strategies that work for
age-structured populations also work for remaining-years-structured populations.

We have also concluded that the year-to-year stability of observed
thanatological age-structure, using our redistribution method, is
greater than that of the same population when structured by
chronological age. This finding is valid for the four decades of US and
Spanish population data used throughout this dissertation, and it has been
confirmed on the basis of all 46 populations in the Human Mortality Database.
One of the implications of this finding is that the pace of
sex-divergence in predictions of future births is slower. This means that the
gap in total births predicted on the basis of male and female fertiltiy rates
and future exposures is smaller when these rates and exposures are structured
by thanatological age than when structured by chronological age. However,
two-sex divergence is not eliminated, and both sexes still must be considered
when modeling or projecting populations structured by remaining years of life.

Of equal or greater importance in this dissertation is the finding that
population renewal models yield incongruous results of structured by
chronological versus thanatological age. This is a new problem to 
which we have offered no solution and from which we hope to inspire future work
from formal demographers. The only exceptions to this incongruity are rare
coincidences and the tautological cases of the initial population state and the
theoretical stable state. We may therefore make a manner of recommendation for
future research toward 1) refining the remaining-years-structured population
model where necessary, 2) reconciling the conflicting results obtained from
these two definitions of age and 3) reconciling both sexes and both
definitions of age in a single model of population renewal. We do not claim that
it will be possible to model the two definitions of age together in a true and
necessary way, but we expect that the attempt to do so will surrender insights
on population dynamics, as has been the case with the long history of two-sex
modeling.

Population projections rarely incorporate males into fertility assumptions. This
assumption, that fertility depends only on females, is called female-dominance,
and in Chapter~\ref{ch:Measuring} we have shown that female dominance is not an
innocuous assumption for the case of age-structured models. . In
Chapter~\ref{sec:modellingapproaches} we set out to provide a suite of standard 
working examples of solutions of two-sex adjustment methods 
so that methods may be compared and implemented by the demographer if desired.
This is a practical concern that has implications on the way
contemporary demography is practiced, albeit within the familiar framework of
age-structured populations. In the following section we provide some
guidance by recommending from among the methods presented.

In changing the definition of population struture, however, we
