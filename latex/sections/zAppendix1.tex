\section{Fertility rates by remaining life expectancy under different assumed
reproductive spans}

One may rightly wish to see $e_x$-classified fertility rates calculated where
exposures in the denominator are taken only from the known reproductive span.
For many, this will more closely represent the population exposed. Bounding the
original age-clsasified exposures introduces a second problem, namely that of
determining the which age-bounds to use for males and females. Results are
sensitive to the choice, especially when comparing males and females, since 1)
the male reproductive span is much longer than the female span, and 2) the
$e_x$-distributed population shows a greater and steadier sex-imbalance than the
age-classified population. As expected, results are sensitive to the choice of
bounds. In following, Figures~\ref{fig:exSFRsurfUS},~\ref{fig:exSFRsurfES}
and~\ref{fig:exTFR} are reproduced after first limiting original
age-classified exposures to certain reproductive bounds. These include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item ages 15-55 for both males and females.
  \item ages 13-49 for females and 15-64 for males.
  \item ages higher than the 1st and lower than the 99th quantiles of ASFR for
  males and females separately and over the entire period studied.
  \item ages higher than the 1st and lower than the 99th quantiles of ASFR for
  each year for males and females separately. ($e_x$-TFR only).
\end{itemize}
