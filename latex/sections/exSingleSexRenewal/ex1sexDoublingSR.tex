The basic projection matrix has been described for the single-sex case. This
tool permits us to repeat the illustrative excercise from
Section~\ref{sec:ageSRdoubling} wherein male and female populations are
projected separately and in parallel until such time as one sex outnumbers the
other sex by a factor of two. Long waiting times indicate less divergence, short
waiting times strong divergence. This exercise is close to being just another
viewpoint on the intrinsic growth rate, except that initial conditions are
expected to be far from stable, and may therefore influence results. Again,
human sex ratios of 2 or \textonehalf are simply absurd, and this species of
indicator merely serves to compare.
