The age-structured pyramid shifts upward by 1 year with
each passing year, with some decrement occurring in each age of life, such that
the essential shape, primarily the result of past fertility\footnote{Thanks are
owed to Kirk Scott for first imparting me with this heuristic.}, takes several
decades to be erased from memory\footnote{Thanks are owed to Anna Cabr\'{e} for
first imparting me with this heuristic.}. Births from the age structured population 
are produced by a wide range of ages in the population pyramid, and these
are assigned to the bottom of the pyramid and are grouped together into a single
cohort. This cohort is heterogeneous with respect to future age (year) at death, 
but is homogeneous with respect to the year of birth. We are familiar with
the way the age-structured population model unfolds, as it
reflects both our experience of life and the history of demography.
