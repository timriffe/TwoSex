The age-structured pyramid shifts upward by 1 year with
each passing year, with some decrement occurring in each age of life, such that
the essential shape, primarily the result of past fertility\footnote{Credit is
owed to Kirk Scott for first imparting me with this heuristic.}, takes tseveral
decades to be erased from memory\footnote{Credit is owed to Anna Cabre for first
imparting me with this heuristic.}. Births from the age structured population 
are assigned to the bottom of the pyramid and are grouped 
together into a single cohort. This cohort is heterogenous with respect to
future age (year) at death, but is
homogenous with respect to the year of birth. We are familiar with
the way the age-structured population model unfolds, as it
reflects both our experience of life and the history of demography.
