 When applied to the data from the US and Spain, we see the trends
displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:rex1sex}. In all years studied, $e_x$-structured
$r$ has been higher than the age-structured $r$, though the overall patterns of
change have been very similar. In that case of US males, in no year studied
has the $e_x$-structured $r^m$ dropped below 0.
