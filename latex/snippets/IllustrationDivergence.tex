Divergence of single-sex population models is problem of practical significance
for demographers, and it stems from the fact that vital rates of increment and
decrement to human populations nearly always (except in rare coindcidences where
rates cross) differ between the sexes. Observed age-specific vital rates for
Spain and the United States serve well to illustrate the peculiarities of the problem.  %
