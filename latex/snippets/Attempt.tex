It has been noted that the observed and expected distributions of births by
remaining years of life of mothers and fathers very closely resemble each other
(See Figure~\ref{fig:TotalVarobsexpex}), almost enough so that we could
approximate the observed distribution by a random distribution given only the
marginal distributions. In any case, the result would be a much closer fit to
observed data than would be the same excercise if undertaken with typical
age-classified data.
