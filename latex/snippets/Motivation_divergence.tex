\citet{kuczynski1932fertility} illustrates an extreme instance of male and
female divergence in net reproduction rates, using French data from
1920-1923. In this case, males showed an NRR of $1.194$ and females an NRR of
$0.977$. If males and females were to be infinitely projected forward
independant of each other based on the invariant rates used to calulate, the
population sex ratio would approach infinity. Indeed any difference in NRR, no
matter how small will lead to such long-run consequences, and this is a
shortcoming of depending heavily on one sex
