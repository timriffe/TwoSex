Recall the observations of \citet{sanderson2005average}, more directly
relating to the popuation pyramid. These authors note that despite ageing in a
population, the mean \textit{remaining} years to be lived may increase. This is due 
to improvements in mortality offsetting (or more than offsetting) increases in
the mean age of a population. I now present a method to exactly redistribute
population counts (or exposures) according to period remaining life
expectancies, rather than according to age per se.

From a given population and year derive male and female lifetables of radix
($l_0$) equal to 1. Note that in this case the $d_x$ column sums to 1, and is therefore a
proper density function. $d_x$ can now be thought of as the probability of dying 
in any given age from the perspective of a 0-year-old, according to the given year's mortality
experience. It follows that the observed population of age 0 can be redistribted
according to $d_x$ and interpreted either as the expected death counts
in each year $t+x$, or as the distribution of persons currently-aged 0
reclassified according to remaining life expectancy. This can be done similarly
for age 1, by ignoring the mortality experience of age 0, and rescaling $d_x$ to
sum to 1, or more generally:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}(D_t) = \int _{a = 0} ^{\infty} P_a \frac{d_a}{\int _{b = a} ^{\infty}
d_b\, \dd b} \;\dd a
\end{equation}
where $P_a$ is the population of age $a$, $d_a$ is the
lifetable density function and $\mathbf{E}(D_t)$ is the expected number of
deaths in each future year $t$, also understood as a vector of the current 
population, redistributed into categories of remaining life expectancy. The key
observation is that we can sidestep the $e_x$ column of the lifetable, since
$e_x$ is essentially a weighted mean of $d_x$. The resulting population pyramid
is heterogeneous with respect to age within any given level of remaining life
expectancy, and looks like
Figures~\ref{fig:exPyrUS} and \ref{fig:exPyrES}\footnote{The idea to
redistribute the population pyramid in this way is due to a conversation with 
John MacInnes, and appears in \citep{MacInnes2013pop} (unpublished) using a
different method.} for the years 1975 and 2009 in the US and Spain. As a helpful
pointer, note that the population at the base of the pyramid is expected to decrement
within the \textit{next year}, thus the vertical axis can also can also be
thought of as year $t+x$, although $e_x$ more clearly identifies the pyramid
with year $t$ mortality conditions. In other words, the pyramid should not be
taken out of context as a forecast. Note that this pyramid represents the
exact same population as an age-classified pyramid: Underlying males sum to the
correct total on the left and females sum to the correct total on the right. Only the definition of age has
changed: instead of counting forward from birth we count \textit{age} in reverse
starting from death. For individuals, this feat would be impossible, but given
 the information contained in a period lifetable,  one can to great utility 
 redistribute population aggregates accoridng to $e_x$.
Both pyramids have been rescaled to sum to 100, in order to more comparably represent population 
structure\footnote{Incidentally, a time series of remaining life expectancy 
pyramids for any given Western country will show incredible stability over time, 
which is remarkable in light of observed ageing in the observed population pyramid. 
The simple interpretation of this kind of pyramid adds to its utility, and this author 
believes that $e_x$-specific population structure, and other here-unmentioned indicators 
that can be derived from this method sould make up a valuable new component to the contemporary
 demographer's toolbox, as well as help inform current population debates.}.

We now apply this same redistribution technique in order to
calculate male and female $e_x$-specific fertility rates, $e_x$-SFR. For any
rate, the numerator and denominator require a common referent, thus both births and
exposures are redistributed according to year $t$ mortality conditions. That
is to say, we take the extra step of moving the age-specific vector
of birth counts (by mothers' or fathers' age) into $e_x$-specific birth
vectors before dividing into exposure. Such a rate cannot be directly compared
with a typical age-specific rate, since the time scales are different, but we 
can indeed apply some familiar tools in order to analyze this new curve. 
Figure~\ref{fig:eSFR2009} shows an example $e_x$-SFR from 2009, for both the US and Spain.

\end{figure}

One may question whether the curve shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eSFR2009} properly
represent rates. This argue that the same definition of events in the
numerator and exposures in the denominator has been applied, only the
structuring variable has changed from \textit{time since birth} to \textit{time
until death} (of progenitor here).

This is, in the best case, a very rough calculation, for several reasons. The
assumption of homogenous mortality is particularly consequential in the case of 
fertility, where health selection is self-evident, but not easily measureable.
It is thus to be expected that the left tails in Figure~\ref{fig:eSFR2009} are
too thick. In contemporary Western populations, female $e_x$-SFR curves will be
further to the right than male curves for two reasons 1) female mortality is
almost universally lower than male mortality at any given age, thus associating
births at a given age with higher remaining life expectancies; 2)
female fertility is more tightly concentrated over young ages, partly due to
upper bound represented by menopause, and partly due to prevailing hypergamy.
Furthermore, exposure is taken from the \textit{entire} population, not merely
the populaton within reproductive ages. The rates could be thusly recalculated,
for instance using female ages $13-50$ and male age $15-65$, and would look like 
Figure~\ref{fig:eSFR2009limits}, a more reasonable if less intelligible result.

Comparing Figures~\ref{fig:eSFR2009} and~\ref{fig:eSFR2009limits} echoes the
comments of \citet{gupta1978alternative} and \citet{mitra1976effect} on the difficulty of
defining an \textit{effective} population for use in exposures. Clearly persons
outside the reproductive age range would conventionally be excluded from
exposures. Other kinds of risk heterogeneity are known to exist, such as age
patterns in fecundability and sexual intercourse, that are unaccounted for in
standard fertility measures. With no pretensions of superiority over the more
restrictive exposures used for Figure~\ref{fig:eSFR2009limits}, we will proceed
in this section by using exposures derived from all ages. One could weakly
defend this choice by noting that we are attempting to measure the period
reproductivity of an \textit{entire} population, not just part of it. The
reproductive span was an outcome of evolution, varies greatly between
individuals and populations, and is mutable, both due to ongoing
population-level genetic and hormonal changes and direct human intervention. We
will for the time being, be content to work with the cruder $e_x$-SFR, and note
that this rate, as any other is amenable to further disaggregation and
decomponsition.

        \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

As is visible in Figures~\ref{fig:exSFRsurfUS}~and~\ref{fig:exSFRsurfES}, 
$e_x$-SFR has changed its level and undergone a gradual displacement over 
time toward higher $e_x$ levels, an altogether propitious development
with respect to human altriciality. The interpretation of this displacement is
entirely different from that of postponement in ASFR. Observed fertility 
postponement should shift $e_x$-SFR unfavorably to higher mortality 
levels (lower $e_x$ levels), however mortality improvements have tended to 
offset this effect, acting to move the curve to higher
remaining life expectancies. This evolution in rates can, as with ASFR, also be
summarized with an indicator akin to TFR, which we here call $e_x$-TFR, as in
Figure~\ref{}.
