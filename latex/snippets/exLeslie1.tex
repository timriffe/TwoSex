This section explains the construction of the Leslie matrix that corresponds to
the two-sex $e_x$-structured population model presented above. The objective is
to offer a practical understanding of the prior formulas, which otherwise stand
on their own. 

We will begin with the one-sex $e_x$-structured Leslie model, and then develop
the projection matrix that corresponds to the two-sex Leslie model presented
earlier.
