Birth counts for Spain were not available in tables in the format required for
this dissertation. For this reason, birth counts were tabulated from birth
register microdata publicly available as fixed-width text files from the 
Instituto Nacional de Estadistica (INE)\citep{MNPnacimientos}\footnote{At the
time of this writing, a further three years of data (up to 2012) were available, but these were not
incorporated into the dissertation body of data.}. Cross-tabulations for each
year included age of mother, age of father and sex of birth. In all cases, age
of mother was stated, but in some cases age of father was missing. In Spain
these cases tended to comprise less than 2\% of all cases. Births with missing
age of father were redistributed proportionately over births to fathers of known
age separately for each age of mother. We do not expect this procedure to affect
results, and no sensitivity tests wre performed.

\subsubsection{US Birth Counts, 1969 - 2009}
Birth counts for the US were not available in tables in the format required for
this dissertation. For this reason, birth counts were tabulated from birth
register microdata publicly available as fixed-width text files from the 
Center for National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
(INE)\citep{NCHS19692009}. Cross-tabulations for each
year included age of mother, age of father and sex of birth. In all cases, age
of mother was stated, but in many cases age of father was missing. The
percent of all births where age of father was not recorded ranged between 7\%
and 18\%, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:USmissingAge}. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]

          \label{fig:USmissingAge}
\end{figure}

Births with missing age of father were redistributed
proportionately over births to fathers of recorded age separately for each
age of mother. The degree of missingness of father's age varies by age of
mother. For ages greater than 25, we do not expect this to affect results in an important
way. Averaged over all years, ages $<= 20$ all had missingness of more than
20\%; ages $<= 16$ had missingness of more than 40\%, and ages $<= 14$ had
missingness of more than 60\%. This may affect results if the age-pattern of
males of undeclared age differs from that of males of declared age in a
non-trivial way. For our purposes, this uncertainty enters into the male
age-pattern of fertility, as well as any case where we rely upon the bivariate
age distribution of births (age of mother by age of father). 

\subsubsection{Exposures and Mortality data}

All other data for the US and Spain were downloaded from the Human Mortality
Database (HMD)\citep{wilmoth2007methods}. These data include most importantly population
exposures by age, sex and year and the deaths distribution, $d_x$, from the sex-specific lifetables. $d_x$ 
informaion was always rescaled to sum to 1, which minimized rounding
errors and made programming simpler. Other items used from the HMD less
consistently included population counts, mortality hazards, $\mu_x$, survival
curves, $l_x$ (also scaled so that $l_0 = 1$), lifetable exposures, $L_x$, life expactancies, $e_0$,
and death counts by Lexis triangles.
