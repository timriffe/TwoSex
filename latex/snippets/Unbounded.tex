\citet{gupta1973}, upon applying the model presented in \citep{gupta1972two}
noted several instances of his two-sex interactive \textit{intrinsic} growth
rate, $r^\ast$ not being bounded by the male and female single-sex intrinsic
growth rates. This observation, contrary to intuition, was justified and
explained in terms of changes inter-age partner availability, a level of
complexity missing from two-sex models at the time. Namely, a functiond designed
to determine the umber of births (marriage) to males of age $x$ and females of
age $y$, $M(P_x^M, P_y^F)$, depends also on the relative availability of
partners in other ages of the oposite sex, and competition from other ages in
one's own sex.
